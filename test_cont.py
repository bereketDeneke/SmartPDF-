ምዕራፍ አንድ

ቦሌ ዓለም አቀፍ አውሮፕላን ማረፊያ ስደረስ ከምሽቱ አንድ ሰዓት

ተኩል ሆኖ ነበር። ከመኪና እንደወረድኩ ሻንጣዎቼን አውርጄ

ለእነርሱ በተዘጋጁ ጋሬዎች ላይ አድርጌ እየገፋሁ ወደ ውስጥ

በፍጥነት ገሰገስኩ። ከዚህ በፊት ዓለም አቀፍ በረራ አድርጌ የማላውቅ

እስከሚመስል ድረስ ከነበርኩበት የመቸኮልና ግራ የመጋባት ስሜት

ውስጥ የመለሰኝ ‹‹አንተን እኮ ነው! አትሰማም እንዴ ትኬትክን

አሳይ እኮ ነው የምልህ!›› የሚለው ቁጣን ያዘለ የአንድ ሴኩሪቲ

ጠይቄ ትኬቱን ከፓስፖርቴ ጋር በአንድነት ሰጠሁት።

‹‹እያዳመጥክ አትሄድም እንዴ! ምን ሆነሃል›› አለኝ።

በማፈር ስሜት ውስጥ ሆፔ ይቅርታ ስጠይቀው ትኬቱን በፓስፖርቴ

ውስጥ አድርጎ ፊት ፊቴን አተኩሮ እያየ መለሰልኝ። ምን ሆኘ

The Santorini eruption. An archaeological investigation of its distal impacts
on Minoan Crete
Jan Driessen
Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium
1. Introduction
Our times are times of crisis. Some would claim that an interest in
crisis and a rise in disaster studies started with the 9/11 WTC attack in
2001, the first in a long series of exceptional disasters that struck the
world, including the Boxing Day South-East Asia tsunami in 2004,
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the Japan
earthquake and tsunami in 2011, and the Arab Spring, starting in 2010,
all killing many thousands of people each and leaving millions home-
less. This actuality is, without doubt, why there is an increased interest
in ancient crises and the way societies in the past coped with unforeseen
events that dramatically impacted on their lives. The high number of
publications and projects concentrating on crisis and collapse can of
course partly be explained by the desire of archaeologists and historians
to show the societal relevance of their fields by arguing that their
findings may provide solutions for the future and, of course, the desire
to obtain funding. Likewise, present-day interest in global warming and
climate change has triggered a proliferation of books and articles on
human ecodynamics — the relationship between climate, environment,
and culture (Sandweiss and Kelley, 2012). In fact, the present attention
to disasters somehow echoes the late 1980s boost in publications re-
lated to collapse and crises (Whittow, 1980; Tainter, 1988; Yoffee and
Cowgill, 1988, see now also Cunningham and Driessen, 2017), under-
lining the popularity of these topics amongst archaeologists and ancient
historians. That they are set to stay on the agenda is further underlined
by a recent paper in American Antiquity in which crisis and collapse
were ranked fifth in a poll asking a large sample of scholars what the
most important topics for exploration would be in the next decade
(Kintigh et al., 2014). Its continuing popularity as a field of research is
amply illustrated by simply typing crisis and collapse into the Scien-
ceDirect search function, an act that yields 867 hits from the beginning
to 2001 and 18,668 since 2001. The main question, as Mary Van Buren
(2001) put it, is how to incorporate natural disasters into archaeological
thinking about social change and the present paper allows me to revisit
our own work (Driessen and Macdonald, 1997; 2000) on the archae-
ologically traceable impact of the mid-2nd millennium BCE Santorini
eruption.
2. The Santorini eruption
Despite continuing interest in the topic - at least two theses (avail-
able online) have been defended on the general aspects of the eruption
(Sewell, 2011; Dunn, 2002; cf. also Meller et al., 2013) – the 2nd mil-
lennium BCE Santorini eruption and its potential effects on Minoan
civilisation continue to divide scientists, especially the questions sur-
rounding its absolute date, the precise sequence of volcanic events, the
size of the eruption, and its impact on the ecosystem of the Ancient
Mediterranean (e.g. Sigurdsson et al., 1990; Tsonis et al., 2010;
Marriner and Morhange, 2013; Cadoux et al., 2015). All these different
questions deserve further attention. Therefore, this paper will focus
exclusively on those archaeological data that may help us appreciate
the distal role the eruption played in the dominant society of the time,
the Minoans.
In the Troubled Island, a monograph published in 1997, it was
claimed that a series of changes in the Aegean, in particular in Cretan or
Minoan Bronze Age society, were triggered by the L(ate) M(inoan) IA
Santorini eruption (Driessen and Macdonald, 1997). Eventually, we
argued, these changes would have caused the breakdown of the Minoan
system over the course of a few generations, during L(ate) M(inoan) IB
or the 15th c. BCE. The eruption, we further hypothesized, would have
initially caused major problems in food production and distribution,
undermining the central authority located at Knossos and leading to a
process of decentralisation. This fragmentation would then have led
incrementally to internal conflict, reflected by the wave of fire de-
structions that can be observed in many LM IB settlements. The situa-
tion normalised again when a new Knossian regime, partly composed of
Mainlanders, restored order. The heyday of Minoan civilisation, how-
ever, was over. Although some scholars (Warren, 2001; Soles, 2009)
have raised objections to the entire hypothesis, and others (Christakis,
1999; 2014; Platon, 2011) have criticised certain details or inter-
pretations – sometimes with justification, as will be shown – our ar-
gument has in general been positively received (e.g. Rehak and
Younger, 1998; Dunn, 2002, 281; Girella, 2013; Gorogianni, 2013).
What we did not claim, however, was a direct causal link between the

LM IA eruption and the LM IB destructions. In fact, traces of a declining
state of society have now been recognised long before the eruption
(Macdonald and Knappett, 2013). The general consensus nowadays is
that ‘Knossos’ (whatever this may stand for) was overwhelmingly pre-
sent throughout large parts of the island in M(iddle) M(inoan) III and
LM IA, profoundly influencing local practices, and potentially sitting at
the top of a state-like structure (Bevan, 2010). At the same time, the
impact of earthquakes, which plagued the island especially during this
period, has become better understood (Jusseret and Sintubin, 2017).
Some combination of seismic activity, diminishing returns and geo-
graphical compartimentalisation, and/or an increasingly inefficient
ruling apparatus that was growing more abstract and remote, may
therefore have simply accelerated the process of disintegration of a pre-
eruption Neopalatial Cretan system that seems to have been relatively
fragile.
In view of the general theme of this issue, the present paper con-
centrates on the effects of the eruption that are archaeologically iden-
tifiable in the material record on the island of Crete during and fol-
lowing the eruption. I also give some attention to the identification of
the agent or agents responsible for the subsequent LM IB destructions
since these too have been given plenty of attention in recent studies
(e.g. Brogan and Hallager, 2011; Puglisi, 2013). It needs to be stressed,
however, that, despite the many destructions and abandonments
documented, Minoan culture survived. This allows us to explore the
society's reaction to natural and man-made catastrophes and to study its
resilience in the form of mechanisms of adaptation, recovery and al-
ternative pathways.
Perhaps some facts first. Firstly, there can be little doubt that the
eruption happened during the ceramic phase we call Late Minoan IA
and, on present evidence, rather late during this phase. We know this
because one of the ceramic type fossils of Late Minoan IB, the ogival
cup, does not occur in pre-Santorini tephra layers on Crete nor on
Rhodes, while it does immediately afterwards. Thus far, there is no
good evidence for a LM IA sub-phase after the eruption. On the other
hand, considerable progress has been made in distinguishing several
moments of destruction within the Late Minoan IB phase on Crete.
Some sites seem to have been destroyed earlier in the period others
suffering only much later, while still others were struck by several de-
structions within this phase (Brogan and Hallager, 2011). The high
number of similarities between decorative styles found at Akrotiri on
Thera and Gournia and Zakros on Crete can then perhaps be explained
by the fact that these sites were destroyed at a moment close in time
(Platon, 2011). There is, however, still no agreement on the absolute
date of the eruption. Quite a few earth scientists take the late 17th c.
BCE date (between 1630 and 1600 BCE) for granted, whereas many
archaeologists stick to the traditional late 16th c. BCE date, roughly
around 1530-1520 BCE. Both camps have a series of convincing argu-
ments but if the earlier date were to prove correct, it would have a
butterfly effect and require a considerable readjustment of traditional
Egyptian chronology on which, through a series of synchronisms, Ae-
gean chronology is constructed. Friedrich and colleagues (2006; 2014)
discovered an olive-tree branch buried alive in the tephra on Santorini
and dated this with 95% confidence in the range 1627–1600 BCE
(Heinemeier and Friedrich, 2009) but this too has recently been criti-
cised (Cherubini et al., 2013; 2014). Moreover, Manning and Kromer
(2012), although defending a high date, admit “the possibility of a mid-
16th century BCE date (within ∼1593–1530 cal BCE)”. Both Felix
Höflmayer (2012) and Malcolm Wiener (2015) have presented sound
analyses of the chronological evidence. They conclude that it remains
safer to accept that the eruption took place after the start of the Egyptian
New Kingdom, i.e. after 1540 BCE, or if the new C14 dates are correct,
in between 1566 and 1552 BCE (68.2% probability) or in between 1570
and 1544 BCE (95.4% probability), but certainly not in the 17th c. BCE.
Following Wiener (2009) and Warren (2009; 2010), a 1525 BCE date
thus remains most plausible. Still, this discussion will continue as long
as no robust local series of stratigraphically fine-tuned C14 dates are
obtained from Cretan sites.
Secondly, there is little doubt that the eruption was preceded and
probably even triggered by one or more earthquakes calculated to have
been around 7 on the Richter scale, since it caused stone staircases to
fracture and walls to tumble (Vougioukalakis, 2006). This earthquake
struck at least several months before the eruption, but opinions as to
how many differ since no erosion of the seismic debris took place. But at
Akrotiri, there is good archaeological evidence that a rescue and de-
molition operation had started after this earthquake: beds had been
taken outside, unsafe walls were being torn down with wrecking-ball
type hammers, recyclable stones had been selected, etc. All these works
were interrupted by the eruption (Doumas, 1983, 134–135; Palyvou,
2005; Vougioukalakis, 2006). During the eruption, too, earth tremors
must have taken place (Saltogianni et al., 2014 - tremors could also
have been caused by volcanic ‘bombs’ [Doumas, 1983, 134–135]). A
similar sequence of events has been reconstructed at certain sites on
Rhodes, Kos and Crete, where earthquake damage is closely associated
with ash fall (Marketou, 2010a; 2010b; Molloy et al., 2014; Soles et al.,
2017) but thus far we have been unable to distinguish between earth-
quakes that preceded the eruption by a few months from those that
accompanied it.
Thirdly, there can be no doubt that, during the eruption, large
amounts of ash and pumice were emitted. How much exactly is a matter
of controversy (Johnston et al., 2014) but many Cretan sites have
yielded deposits of tephra, discussed below, and these are, for the
moment, our paramount evidence for the distal impact of the eruption.
The great unknown remains the size of the eruption (M6?, M7?) and the
total volume of dense-rock ejecta, a question on which volcanologists
still do not agree (Johnston et al., 2014). This figure has been lowered
by some, such as Pyle (1997) but increased by others (such as Tsonis
et al., 2010); some believe there was no or little global impact, others a
great deal (Riley, 2004).
Fourthly, it may be assumed that this eruption (and/or the asso-
ciated earthquakes) was accompanied by one or more tsunamis. This
was already convincingly shown through a study of seabed anomalies
by Kastens and Cita (1981) and recently confirmed by the discovery of a
sedimentary deposit on the continental shelf off Caesarea Maritima,
Israel, dated and attributed to tsunami waves produced during the Late
Bronze Age eruption of Santorini (Goodman-Tchernov et al., 2009;
2011). Work by Sakellariou et al. (2012) around Santorini itself leaves
no doubt about the reality of tsunami generation and simulations by
Novikova et al. (2011) suggest that the north coast of Crete was struck
by highly variable wave amplitudes, ranging from negligible to 28 m.
These, however, presuppose caldera collapse, and since this can no
longer be claimed, tsunamis can only have been caused by pyroclastic
flows, with the implication that their magnitude should be downsized
(already Pareschi et al., 2006). Estimates of a maximum height up to
10–12 m (Nomikou et al., 2016) are more reasonable. Unfortunately,
certain Atlantis-like catastrophe scenarios (e.g. Perianez and Abril,
2014, cf. Marriner and Morhange, 2013) incorporating monster waves
seem more influenced by the 2004 Boxing Day and 2011 Japan dis-
asters than based on actual archaeological evidence. Since the presence
of pumice in the 13th c. BCE ruins of Gouves cited by Minoura et al.
(2000) should be entirely dismissed as tsunami-related (cf. Gaignerot-
Driessen and Driessen, 2012, for the presence of pumice in con-
temporary layers at Sissi and Malia), the evidence for tsunamis on Crete
remains extremely meagre. Only the shore deposit at Palaikastro on the
east coast of the island (Bruins et al., 2008; 2009) which comprises a
mixture of LM IA sherds, architectural debris, Theran ash and other
commingled material, including maritime foraminifera and marine
molluscs, may effectively represent the remains of tsunami action (e.g.
Goodman-Tchernov et al., 2009; Höflmayer, 2012; Bruins, this vo-
lume). However, this suggestion may need independent confirmation as
well as a much more robust representation of the geoarchaeological

evidence, including section drawings, a proper framing within a local
and regional contextual and geomorphological study, and a complete
seashore reconstruction. It cannot be excluded that part of this deposit –
which extends over ca. 100m along the shore – includes the debris of a
flash flood that was caused by extreme weather conditions accom-
panying the eruption. At nearby Choiromandres, flash floods seem to
have affected the dams (Vokotopoulos et al., 2014, and see below), and,
during their reconstruction, a foundation deposit with specially col-
lected Theran tephra was installed, which seems to imply that the da-
mage happened at the time of the Santorini eruption. Flash floods are
not uncommon in this part of the island and can cause considerable
damage: in 1901, for example, a storm carried more than 4,000 trees to
the sea (Hogarth, 1901: 123). More such cases are known from the
historical records of the island (Rackham and Moody, 1997). The dearth
of geoarchaeological evidence for tsunamis is matched by the general
absence of archaeological signs for such an event even if we cannot
exclude the possibility that tsunami action was in fact responsible for
the poor conservation of LM IA levels in North Cretan coastal settle-
ments. If so, we may have underestimated the capacity of humans to
recover and to clean up effectively after disasters, be they earthquakes
or tsunamis (Driessen and MacGillivray, 2011).
Fifth and last, there can be no doubt that a wave of fire destructions
affected Cretan settlements during and at the end of the ceramic phase
we call Late Minoan IB. These destructions have variously been at-
tributed by archaeologists to internal revolt, Knossian expansion,
Mycenaean invasion, or to a major natural disaster involving earth-
quakes. Hypotheses such as that advanced by Gorokhovich (2005) and
Gorokhovich and Ullmann (2010), that earthquake damage to aquifers
and changes in groundwater supplies formed a potential reason for the
collapse or that it was caused by climate change (Tsonis et al., 2010),
may be attractive to the general public but are still far from being ar-
chaeologically confirmed. Climate change or environmental deteriora-
tion remain avenues for earth scientists to explore in detail. The ar-
chaeological evidence, however, favours humans as being responsible
for at least some of the destructions, for the following reasons (Fig. 1):
1. The selectivity of the fire destructions. In some Minoan settlements
(e.g. Petras, Myrtos-Pyrgos), only the central buildings burnt down,
with the surrounding houses escaping destruction, while in others
(e.g. Knossos), only the houses were destroyed, with the central
buildings themselves remaining untouched.
2. Much destruction involved burning. In LM IB, fire is the only destruc-
tion agent that can be identified with absolute certainty. Although
earthquakes may also occasionally cause fires to break out, seismic
destructions can only be rarely be identified for this period (for
Mochlos, see Soles et al., 2017, also Macdonald, 2017 on Archanes).
3. Fires seem to have been prepared. Considerable evidence exists for the
presence of brush wood and other flammable materials being
brought into the buildings that subsequently burned down
(Cunningham, 2007).
4. The absence of later reconstruction and reoccupation. In earlier periods
of Minoan history, earthquake destructions were always followed by
reconstruction and reoccupation. This does not happen after the LM
IB destructions.
5. Plunder and malicious destruction. Certain LM IB destruction deposits
do not contain any valuables or metals while others illustrate the
smashing and the intentional breaking of prestigious artwork, as is
best illustrated by the chryselephantine Palaikastro Kouros
(Driessen and Macdonald, 1997; Macdonald, 2017).
6. Emergency measures. Many sites witness remarkable pre-destruction
activities, such as the protection of access, water supplies and live-
stock, and the hiding/hoarding of valuables, which all seem to re-
flect emergency procedures as reactions to imminent danger
(Driessen, 1995, 1997).
7. A succession of destructions. At certain sites, several phases of de-
structive events can be recognised during LM IB. This suggests that
the troubles were more of a prolonged duration than a short-term
event. This too suggest human intervention (Rethemiotakis and
Christakis, 2011, 227).

If more evidence for selective destruction and the smashing of
prestigious items can be found during future excavations, the case for
human aggression would become stronger. Moreover, it would imply
that the aggression was directed primarily at symbols of authority. This
then would in turn allow looking for a social explanation for the demise
of Minoan palace culture in LM IB (Driessen and Macdonald, 1997;
2000).
The main question is of course whether the process that led to the
breakdown of Minoan society in LM IB or approximately 1450 BCE was
set in motion by the effects of Santorini eruption two or three genera-
tions earlier. Was the eruption a catalyst (through the damage caused
by earthquake, ash-fall, tsunami, anomalous weather, etc.) which trig-
gered a disintegration process? Our thesis in the Troubled Island was
that these effects indeed caused severe economic dislocation, which
forced local centres to adapt and to assume greater independence from
the regional authorities, represented by the palatial centres. This de-
centralisation, we argued, led to political fragmentation and internal
conflict with increasing competition, largely related to the acquisition
of resources, between the haves and have-nots, the elites (some newly
constituted) and non-elites. We saw something like a state of anarchy at
the end of the LM IB period that eventually paved the way for a
Mycenaean intervention and Crete's gradual absorption into the
Mycenaean, and hence Greek, world.
3. Transformation studies
When writing the book in 1997, disasters as transformative events
had not yet received much attention. This has changed, no doubt partly
influenced by some popular books (Diamond, 2005 - but see McAnany
and Yoffee, 2010 and Cunningham and Driessen, 2017, for approaches
that defend historical particularism and multiple strands of explanation
rather than generalization). A disaster is an event that involves a
“combination of a potentially destructive agent(s) from the natural and/or
technological environment and a population in a socially and technologically
produced condition of environmental vulnerability” (Oliver-Smith, 1996,
305; cf. Rodriguez et al., 2007). The impact of disasters on human so-
cieties depends on the magnitude, duration and frequency of the phe-
nomenon, on its impact on natural resources, on the pre-existing
adaptive strategies of the affected human population and on the event's
size and distribution. Moreover, it very much depends on the human
populations' resilience, their ability to anticipate, contend with, and
recover from a disaster, or their vulnerability, the degree to which they
experience harm (Turner et al., 2003; Riede, 2015). Furedi (2007) has
argued that community response to a disaster episode is far more likely
to be defined by its vulnerability than its resilience and that vulner-
ability is a cultural construct, a state of mind, rather than a state of
being that emerges in response to a disaster, i.e. it is something that
precedes, not follows, disaster (also Cardona, 2003). The impact of a
disaster, then, is strongly governed by both the nature of the hazard and
the characteristics of the population at risk (Blaikie et al., 1994). When
disasters damage the major socioeconomic organizational elements and
physical facilities of a community to such a degree that the essential
functions of that society are interrupted or destroyed, individual and
group stress combined with social disorganization is the result. Dis-
asters, therefore, tend to affect most aspects of community life
(Alexander, 1997).
With this in mind, we can look at the archaeological record of Late
Minoan I Crete and distinguish between three moments of importance:
before (MM III-LM IA), during (LM IA end) and after (LM IB) the
eruption. It is only through such a finer chronological distinction that
we can try to identify whether the effects of the eruption left any trace
on Minoan culture.
4. Prior to the eruption
Recent research has revised the traditional, one-sided view of
Neopalatial Minoan Cretan society as a golden age prior to the eruption
(Macdonald and Knappett, 2013). There is more and more evidence, for
example, that Middle Minoan IIIA was a moment of major change when
quite some exceptional ashlar buildings were built, including those at
Kommos, Galatas, Palaikastro (Block M), Sissi and Gournia. The palace
at Knossos was also rebuilt and some authors claim that the Middle
Minoan III period represented the real period of Knossian expansion
whereas, by the mature LM IA phase, signs of trouble were already
evident with some important settlements abandoned (details in
Driessen et al., 2002). Sites that seem to have been either in ruin or in
decline in the mature LM IA period comprise most of the Messara sites,
including Phaistos, Hagia Triada and Kommos, but also Galatas and
Sissi, perhaps Malia and most of the sites in the Mirabello Bay and East
Crete. The palace of Knossos also has some considerable LM IA deposits,
which is also suggestive of a major disturbance in this phase, but it lacks
LM IB deposits which are, however, frequent outside the palace
(Macdonald, 2017). The construction of the palace of Phaistos, and
probably that of Zakros and the monumentalizations observed at Pa-
laikastro and Mochlos, are, however, LM IB undertakings. Neither
Phaistos nor Zakros may have had a palace in LM IA (La Rosa, 2002, 83;
Platon, 2002), while occupation at Hagia Triada was sparse at the most
and central building T at Kommos was already in ruins with a kiln built
on top of its south stoa and grinding activities taking place within its
north stoa (Shaw, 2002, 101). The same goes for the ceremonial
buildings at Galatas, Kastelli Pediada and Sissi: the latest pottery on
their floors is early LM IA (Rethemiotakis, 2002, 60, 65; Rethemiotakis
and Christakis, 2011, 226; Driessen, 2018). All three complexes were
built during Middle Minoan IIIA or B and are seen as Knossian-inspired
constructs. The same is true for the central area of the settlement at
Palaikastro: in Middle Minoan III, a Knossian-looking building with
pier-and-door partition, columns, court and frescoes was constructed
but it was already in ruins and scavenged before the eruption took place
(Knappett and Cunningham, 2012). Several quarters of Gournia town
were deserted during LM IB while the palace façade was patched up
with recycled ashlar (J. McEnroe, pers. com.). This state of affairs is also
reflected by survey data: only in the Knossos region is there a con-
siderable increase in the number and density of occupation in LM IA,
while elsewhere there is a decrease (Driessen, 2001a; Bevan, 2010).
From MM IIIA into LM IA, Knossos most certainly had close contacts
with Santorini, as is illustrated by the presence of Knossian sealings
found at Akrotiri, some actually impressed by the same gold rings that
left impressions in other Minoan sites (Goren and Panagiotopoulos,
2009). These facts, combined with other features (Wiener, 2016), may
provide some support for the claim of a Knossian supremacy. Perhaps
this means that, in MM IIIB and early LM IA, previously independent
political units were incorporated into a Knossian state, in which earlier
palatial centres were demoted to secondary centres while others were
promoted from tertiary to secondary centres in an attempt to under-
mine local traditional power relations. This would evidently have been
accompanied by an agricultural overspecialisation and an intensifica-
tion in the complexity of hierarchical and administrative structure,
rendering the system unstable and hence vulnerable (Hamilakis, 1996;
Haggis, 2002).
5. During the eruption
The most convincing evidence for a direct impact of the various
eruptive processes on the island of Crete is still very much represented
by layers of volcanic Santorini ash in stratified archaeological contexts.
One recent study on tephra deposition heavily relies on seabed cores,
and argues that Crete would not have been affected much (Johnston
et al., 2012), but this view needs to be adjusted by a more solid re-
appraisal of the data (Athanassas et al., 2017), which also takes account
of the tephra found on Crete itself. Leaving aside non-Cretan sites, such
as those on Rhodes, Kos and on the West coast of Asia Minor (Niemeier
in Cunningham, 2011, 237), where ash fall was much more

considerable, the Cretan evidence may briefly be reiterated. Our wes-
ternmost (and most recent) certified case of tephra comes from the site
of Sissi, 4 km east of the palatial centre at Malia, where a water-borne
layer comprising Santorini tephra lapilli, confirmed through chemical
and microscopic analyses by Christine Lane, mixed with LM IA pottery
was redeposited on a ramp next to the abandoned remains of the cer-
emonial building (Driessen, 2018). About 40 km to the east, at Prinia-
tikos Pyrgos in the Bay of Mirabello, a considerable layer of tephra,
10 cm thick, was discovered in a context with LM IA pottery im-
mediately above a street surface. This tephra, too, was redeposited by
water action. Here, as at Sissi, deposition coincides with the end of
occupation in the immediate neighbourhood (Molloy et al., 2014). The
next site, about 15 km further east, is Mochlos, where several instances
of tephra deposition, 5–10 cm thick, were identified in clear strati-
graphical contexts throughout the Neopalatial town (Soles, 2009).
Some of this may actually represent the result of direct wind-blown
action. The coastal site of Papadiokampos, 40 km east of Mochlos, has
also yielded several tephra layers in clear stratigraphical contexts, some
of considerable thickness (15 cm). Part of one layer may be wind-
blown, but the remaining are water-borne (Brogan and Sofianou, 2009).
The thickest deposit of tephra (ca. 15–20 cm) was found again 30 km
east, in Block M at Palaikastro, where it may also have a combined
wind-and water-borne origin. Other smaller deposits of tephra were
found throughout and outside of the town (Driessen et al., 2006;
Knappett and Cunningham, 2012). A 10–12 cm thick layer of tephra has
also been reported from within the Pelekita cave near Zakros, ca. 18 km
south of Palaikastro, but this has not yet been published. Finally, at
Choiromandres, approximately 10 km south of Zakros, close to a
Minoan country building with annexed agricultural terraces and a
water collection system, a foundation deposit composed of a vase,
containing pure tephra, probably intentionally collected, was placed
beneath a dam during the early LM IB phase. Incidentally, the same
archaeological team was able to show that considerable rainfall had
intensified erosion, forcing the Minoans to modify field systems pre-
cisely at the time of the eruption (Chryssoulaki et al., 1990;
Vokotopoulos et al., 2014, 257–258). The massive concentration of
tephra in East Crete undoubtedly suggests that this part of the island
was differently affected from the central and western regions and, even
if most of these deposits were water-borne redepositions, they never-
theless suggest that the original tephra cover may have been con-
siderable. In Central and West Crete, however, the tephra fall must have
been much lighter, since it is only identified as particles (Siart et al.,
2008; Siart and Eitel, 2013). In any case, volcanic ash remains our most
tangible evidence for the Santorini eruption, but we have made little
progress in identifying its short-and long-term consuequences. As for
short-term effects, intensive rainfall may explain the cases of tephra re-
deposition. We can also assume that the hiding of the sun and moon
with darkness had a profound psychological impact, causing panic, but
again this is conjectural. There have also been claims that Santorini
tephra contained a relatively high fluorine content, potentially poiso-
nous and capable of polluting water supplies, killing animals and de-
stroying crops, but thus far, no conclusive research has been carried out
on this. Likewise, if the sulphuric acid aerosol was considerable, cli-
matological anomalies and even a volcanic winter may have occurred,
again with disastrous consequences for agriculture and society but,
apart from dendrochronological anomalies and the water erosion
events noted above, no study has picked up on this lead (Rampino et al.,
1988). There are, therefore, still a number of questions to be addressed
by earth scientists before a robust conclusion can be reached.
6. After the eruption
Disaster studies have shown how such events produce long-term
effects that act as catalysts for political, economic, social and psycho-
logical actions (Gibbs, 2000; 2003; Leach, 1994; Dynes and Tierney,
1994). With these studies in mind, we may now evaluate what the
combined outcome of a potentially vulnerable societal situation on the
island of Crete was when it was faced with the effects of the eruption. It
may be best to distinguish between an emergency phase, the period
during which the immediate impact of the disaster was most strongly
felt, and a rehabilitation phase, when attempts were made to bring the
community back to its former level of existence. Crisis studies have
shown that violence, antisocial behaviour and community conflicts are
in fact rather rare in the emergency period, but frequent during the
rehabilitation period because of the discriminatory nature of the re-
covery process, when underprivileged minority groups find it much
more difficult to regain their former level of subsistence and unleash
their grievances. Conflict then usually arises because of problems with
the allocation of resources for rehabilitation and the assignment of
blame (Brändström, 2016). Regarding the emergency phase, we can be
brief: the number of settlements (or residences therein), of ritual sites
and of funerary sites that were abandoned during Late Minoan IA is
considerable (Driessen and Macdonald, 1997; details on new sites can
be found in Driessen and Langohr, 2014; Macdonald, 2017) but apart
from the above mentioned cases of Sissi and Priniatikos Pyrgos, where
tephra actually seals the abandonment phase, we cannot yet distinguish
archaeologically between a mature (i.e. prior the eruption) and final
(i.e. contemporary to the eruption) LM IA abandonment. Serious LM IA
destructive events have been confirmed at Chania, Zominthos, Knossos,
Poros, Galatas, Zakros, Petras, Mochlos, Symi, Papadiokampos, and Vai,
which sometimes, correctly or not, have been explicitly connected to
the Santorini eruption. The wholesale or partial reconstruction of some
settlements early in LM IB, discussed below, may also be a sign that the
LM IA damage caused during the eruption was considerable. Again,
however, this is conjectural. Whether specific archaeological features,
such as the abandonment of older wells and the digging of new ones,
were caused by tephra-pollution needs further investigation, but the
Choiromandres evidence mentioned above could point in this direction.
Moreover, if a sudden increase in the mortality rate occurred because of
the impact of the eruption's distal effects (cf. Blaikie et al., 1994;
McCaughey et al., 1994; Doocy et al., 2013), alternative methods of
body disposal may have been necessary to control the spread of disease
and/or maintain certain social or religious standards. And although this
could partly explain the absence of burials during LM IB, it does not do
so for the earlier periods (Devolder, 2010). Our main challenge remains
finding sufficient funerary data, and thus osteological evidence, for the
period in question that would allow us to assess the impact of the
eruption and subsequent events on men, women and children.
As far as the rehabilitation period and the post-eruption period are
concerned, it has become clear that LM IB was a (much?) longer phase
than the single generation once assumed by Mervyn Popham (1967). A
recently published volume on LM IB pottery (Brogan and Hallager,
2011) presents a wealth of new data and is especially relevant for the
recognition of LM IB sub-phases at various sites such as Kommos, Hagia
Triada, Malia, Pseira, Chania and Gournia (Watrous et al., 2015;
Gorogianni, 2013), in addition to the previously known cases of Mo-
chlos and Palaikastro. And, although there is still much room for a
refinement of internal LM IB stylistic phasing, partly by paying more
attention to local developments and less to fragmentary elite wares, we
are on much firmer ground when it comes to recognising a pattern of
intermittent and non-contemporaneous destructions, reinforcing the
impression of a longer period of crisis rather than a single event. In the
Messara, for example, the Phaistos palace and the Hagia Triada villa
reale were destroyed by fire in LM IB, but at both sites slightly later LM
IB contexts also exist, namely the Chalara house at Phaistos and the
edificio ouest at Hagia Triada (Cucuzza, 2011). Similar sequences have
been observed at nearby Kommos. The LM IB destructions at Knossos
are said to be contemporary with those at Tylissos and Nirou Chani but
later than those in the Messara, while the LM IB destruction at Pseira
happened earlier than those at Gournia and Mochlos. This underlines
the necessity of presenting site-based relative chronologies: archae-
ological levels are caused by specific events. If nothing remarkable

happens, no deposition occurs (Driessen, 2013). This finer chron-
ological resolution allows us to return to the discussion of how the al-
location of resources for rehabilitation and the assignment of blame
manifested themselves materially during the post-eruption period.
Where the allocation of resources is concerned, many authors have
underlined the role of famine as an accelerator of historical change,
with effects on demography, economy, politics, society and culture
(Vanhaute, 2015). Frequent cultural responses to reduced harvest yields
include a reduction in population size, a change in the distribution of
human groups (including their mobility patterns), a diversification of
production and the conversion of food into direct and indirect storage,
all features evidenced during LM IB (Driessen and Macdonald, 1997).
The best evidence for increased food production comes perhaps from
the previously mentioned central building at Galatas where a very large
number of ground stone implements (519 of which 429 were quern
stones) as well as ovens were found (Rethemiotakis, 2002). These
suggest industrialised production rather than a normal subsistence
pattern, with the collection, transformation and perhaps distribution of
cereals organized on a massive scale. Often, however, it is not the lack
of resources but rather their distribution that is problematic, since
disasters often disrupt the infrastructure. This is how I read the paper by
Knappett et al. (2011): using computational network analysis, they
suggest that the Minoan collapse at the end of LM IB was one result of
an incremental increase in exchange costs required to maintain com-
mercial ties following the disappearance of Santorini as a key node in
the network, with the remaining sites concentrating their exchange/
trade efforts into a smaller number of stronger links at the expense of
weaker ones. Likewise, a tendency for hoarding, which is very evident
in LM IB, may also be considered as disruptive to the exchange system.
That resources were especially under threat during LM IB is underlined
by what I have dubbed crisis archaeology (Driessen, 1995), the ar-
chaeological correlates of what may be called post-and pre-traumatic
stress syndromes (cf. Zuckerman, 2007; Driessen, 2013). Our original
argument for a prolonged period of crisis relied heavily on an evalua-
tion of material culture as an indicator of ancient emergencies (Driessen
and Macdonald, 1997), which has since been confirmed by more recent
archaeological finds. Architectural modifications especially reflect a
tendency to render access to the interior of residences more difficult
and secure – a kind of warchitecture (Herscher, 2008; Lahoud, 2010;
Mateo, 2010). Thus, at Chania in West Crete, Maria Andreadaki-Vlazaki
(2011, 73–74) notes extensive repairs and the presence of make-shift
features in the architecture, which, she suggests, reflects a crisis situa-
tion in the last days of the LM IB settlement. The same has been noted
for the palace at Zakros (Platon, 2011, 609) while both at Chania and
elsewhere (as for example, at Papadiokampos, Kastelli Pediada, and
perhaps Skinias, in addition to those already known), prestigious rooms
such as the Minoan Halls went out of use before the final LM IB de-
struction. In other sites, like at Pseira, there was only a squatter occu-
pation in the final LM IB phase (Betancourt, 2011). A feature which has
also been emphasized during recent excavations is the increase in sto-
rage space in the mature LM IB phase. This is clear at Petras
(Tsipopoulou and Alberti, 2011, 463) but has also been stressed for
Skinias-Kolokithi (Mandalaki, 2011, 390), Palaikastro (Cunningham,
2011, 264), Sphendili (Christakis et al., 2015) and Archanes-Tourko-
geitonia where a fine ashlar hall was used as a pithos storage room
before the LM IB destruction (Macdonald, 2017). Storage also appears
to have been essential in the central building at Damantri near Protoria
in the Eastern Messara (cf. Driessen and Langohr, 2014). All these
buildings burned down in LM IB. It is possible that this increase in
storage should be read as an increase in conspicuous consumption by
elites which, in turn, augmented the pressure on lower classes, further
aggravated by environmental stress (Christakis, 1999; 2014, 253;
Rethemiotakis and Christakis, 2011, 227). While the degraded nature of
most settlements on Crete after the eruption has been noted, several
witness more intense construction activity up to the eve of the LM IB
destruction. In some cases, as at Gournia, this rebuilding, repair and
construction may have been necessitated because of the damage caused
by the earthquake and direct impact of the eruption, thus explaining the
makeshift character of some of the structures. In other cases, however,
this post-eruption phase is characterized by a major investment. At
Phaistos and Zakros, monumental palatial structures were constructed,
while at Mochlos, Hagia Triada and Palaikastro, existing structures
were monumentalized, especially through the construction of invasive
architectural features such as ashlar veneers. Nevertheless, the obvious
signs for conspicuous consumption and energy investment – not only in
architecture but also in luxury objects made of ivory, stone and metal –
that can be shown to have taken place after the eruption and in the
period before the final LM IB destruction, have usually been taken at
face value, rather than as a blatant sign of a system breakdown. Indeed,
symbolically charged production and consumption appear to have be-
come incrementally centralised in LM IB, showing up in fewer elite
contexts than in earlier periods. This may well suggest a greater in-
equality and, therefore, a source of discontent. Rather than a sign of
affluence, these signs may hence be interpreted as attempts to hide a
system breakdown, which was actually exacerbated by concurrent in-
creased investment (cf. Bernard, 2012). The generally standardised,
monotonous and lower quality of LM IB ceramic material, as seen at
Chania, Palaikastro, Malia, Zakros and Mochlos (e.g. Barnard and
Brogan, 2011), with special wares (such as Marine Style) forming only a
tiny fraction of the assemblage, hints at a similar situation.
The general psychological consequences and the unusual behaviour
provoked by the allocation of blame following disasters have been stu-
died in detail (references in Black, 1981; Hansell et al., 2006; Johrendt,
2007; Doocy et al., 2013). As one example, we can cite the study by
Adams and Adams (1984), who describe how, during the seven months
following the Mt St Helens eruption, there was an 18.6% increase in
mortality rate, a 21% increase in emergency room visits, a 198% in-
crease in stress-related illnesses, a 235% increase in mental illnesses, a
25.5% increase in sick leave, a 45.5% increase in domestic violence,
and a 37.5% increase in aggression in the area where the ash had fallen
(cf. Shore et al., 1986). One consequence which has been noted in
several case-studies is a greater cohesion amongst local groups, which,
in political terms, sometimes translates into moves towards re-
gionalism, decentralization and the formation of new groups
(Kirschenbaum, 2003; Rodriguez et al., 2007; Stor et al., 2016). 'Acts of
God' may represent an easy way out for modern-day insurance com-
panies, but disasters in ancient societies were closely connected to re-
ligion and ritual (Douglas, 1995; Driessen, 2001b; 2015). We have al-
ready drawn attention to the many ritual and religious changes that can
be observed immediately following the eruption. These include the
potential tsunami-inspired origin of Marine Style decoration for ex-
ceptional symbolic ceramics, but also the change from a female to a
male supreme divinity, the abandonment of natural sanctuaries, etc.
(Driessen and Macdonald, 1997; Driessen, 2001b; 2015). Since there is
a widespread tendency to explain disasters in terms of the sins of the
people or its leaders, victimization and scapegoating are common
human reactions in the aftermath of disasters. Such blame is often di-
rected against specific, individual groups, especially during the re-
covery process. The biased nature of violent destruction contexts (e.g.
restricted to the central building of a settlement) and the intentional
destruction of status objects mentioned above clearly suggest that such
victimization took place. Blame may have also played a role in the post-
disaster phase when it comes to issues of authority and leadership, as
new, strong figures or charismatic persons may have replaced earlier
institutionalized and more collective or corporate lines of command
(McCaughey et al., 1994; Rodriguez et al., 2007). Whatever the parti-
culars, the potential for radical change resulting in uncommon au-
thority structures and innovative social organization exists. The rather
sudden attention to male figures – very often in isolated position – in
Minoan iconography during the post-eruption period can then perhaps
be interpreted as a change that suggests incipient kingship for which
there is absolutely no prior evidence. The evidence for increased

martiality put forward by Molloy (2012), combined with the prolonged
state of uncertainty as suggested by successive LM IB destruction levels,
may indicate that, during the post-eruption phase, one-time ceremonial
buildings lost their collective aspect and were usurped by a more in-
dividualistic, elite type of control, thus paving the way for the later
Mycenaean wanax or king. It has also become more evident that, during
the post-eruption LM IB phase, Mycenaean involvement manifests itself
in a much more tangible way, not only in the Cyclades and on Kythera,
but also in Asia Minor (Mountjoy, 2004; Mountjoy and Ponting, 2000).
In terms of pure quantity - and the publication of Skinias and Makry-
ghialos (in Brogan and Hallager, 2011) has added more examples -, the
number of Mycenaean imports and imitations is much higher on LM IB
Crete than during the more advanced Late Bronze Age (LM II-IIIA/B1).
It is hence very likely that Mainlanders were involved in the post-
eruption history of the island. They were certainly present at LM II
Chania where the Argive connections of the warrior graves are clear
(Andreadaki-Vlazaki, 2010). They may have taken advantage of the
situation to replace the Minoans gradually, first on the islands and
eventually at some places on Crete itself.
7. Conclusions
In this paper, I have argued that the basic hypothesis presented in
1997 - that of a gradual process of disintegration of Minoan society over
the course of several generations triggered by the Santorini eruption
rather than a single dramatic event that took place at the end of the
period - still stands. Certain elements, such as the greater resolution of
different phases in LM IB and the increased importance of MM IIIA-B for
understanding the subsequent periods, have helped to provide greater
historical precision. Moreover, new finds of tephra and sound archae-
ological contexts all reinforce the picture of a crisis on Crete well before
its societal system finally broke down. What I hope I also have done is
highlight what kind of evidence we still need to strengthen this hy-
pothesis: well-dated archaeological sequences that span the entire
period in question; sound human and faunal osteological data that may
inform on potential effects of the eruption, and finally, an island-wide
program of geomorphological coring that could provide us with a ro-
bust series of soil analyses that would not only detect the presence and
importance of tephra in regional signatures, but would also assess its
potential effects on land use and human activities. The results of these
analyses could then also be used as proxies by climatologists to identify
weather-induced erosion patterns during the period in question. We still
do not know whether the people of Thera managed to escape from their
disintegrating island since we lose track of them post-eruption. Whether
refugees succeeded in reaching friendly shores seems altogether un-
likely, despite the presence of some isolated Cycladic features at LM IB
Myrtos-Pyrgos, on the southern island of Gavdos and, further away, at
Morphou Bay on Cyprus (Catling, 1980; Cadogan, 1984; Kopaka, 2015).
It is more likely that they perished en route.
Whether the picture I have drawn here comes close to Tainter
(1988)'s law of diminishing returns awaits to be seen. Was the Minoan
system bound for collapse from the outset? Were elites not willing to
adapt, instead remaining too focused on feeding on a ‘weakened po-
pulation’ with the eruption simply accelerating the situation? With the
law of diminishing returns, one would assume that the collapse was
something of a sensible economic decision, decreasing political com-
plexity, breaking down the social landscape into more simple units and
eliminating the cost of the managerial organization (cf. Rethemiotakis
and Christakis, 2011). The subsequent Mycenaean-inspired period, LM
II-IIIA/B, seems, however, to suggest that the opposite was the case,
with an even more complex administrative organization based on the
introduction of a new language using Linear B script (Driessen and
Langohr, 2007). Future research should focus on clarifying the socio-
political situation during the LM I period and establishing whether the
system was indeed unstable, requiring only the eruption and its
accompanying effects to push the system to, and beyond, its inherent
limits.
